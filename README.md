# Sierpinski triangle generator
This program generates sierpinski triangle by using recursive function. For now recursion level of 7 is hard-coded into program. In the future I will probably add zooming and user-selectable recursion level.
## Installation
You need **MinGW 7.3.0** compiler and **SFML 7.3.0 32-bit for MinGW** installed on your system. Then change SFML paths in Makefile, so they will reflect folder structure on your system. Next, you can compile project by using `mingw32-make` command in cmd.exe or PowerShell.
